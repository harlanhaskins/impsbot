               As always, they will be responsible for cleaning the Lounge,
               User Center, and Software room. It is up to you three to decide how
               to divy the work.

               Here are some basic things that should be completed each time a room is cleaned:
               - Surfaces are wiped down with disinfectant wipes or cleanser, don't forget the doors
               - Windows and glass is cleaned.
               - Pick up any garbage (look around)
               - Vacuum each room, the floor vacuum is in the RA's room.

               If you have any questions, talk to Imps.
